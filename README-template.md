## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned to use responsive layouts and use semantics tags. This is my first job without the help of a mentor or video class.


### Continued development

In my future projects, I will study these concepts and apply again all these tools. I'm very happy with my job.

### Useful resources

- Bootstrap 5 helped me with the cards.
